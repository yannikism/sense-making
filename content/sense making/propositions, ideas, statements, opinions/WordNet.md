**WordNet** is a lexical database of semantic relations between words that links words into semantic relations including synonyms, hyponyms](/en/Hyponyms "Hyponyms"), and meronyms. The synonyms are grouped into synsets with short definitions and usage examples. It can thus be seen as a combination and extension of a dictionary and thesaurus. While it is accessible to human users via a web browser its primary use is in automatic text analysis and artificial intelligence applications.

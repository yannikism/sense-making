The technical foundation of the Semantic Web is given by the standards [RDF - Resource Description Framework](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/RDF "Special:MyLanguage/RDF") (for data description), [OWL - Web Ontology Language](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/OWL "Special:MyLanguage/OWL") (for giving the RDF terms a formal meaning), and [SPARQL - Protocol and RDF Query Language](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/SPARQL "Special:MyLanguage/SPARQL") (as a query language and protocol).

A not too simplified view of the Semantic Web is to think of the Semantic Web to traditional databases like the Web was to hypertext systems.

# reflection

gut gemacht:

- von Idee über Planung zur Umsetzung: alles richtig gemacht

- choice to cancel input from whatsApp
- to take the more expensive, but more uncomplicated way

- entscheidung als volunteer mitzumachen
	- erste kontaktpunkte
	- weniger bezahlen
	- good input
- answer to some of my questions from my vault where I otherwise wouldnt know where to start searching for an answer
- did this thing alone
	- company would have been cool though
- stay at hostel
- went jogging to get an overview over the city; very [[yannik-friendly]]
	- be there one day before the actual event,
	- have a look at the workshop rooms one day before the event
- speaking with people
- sign up early to host the workshops that seemed most promising to me
- decided to use the possibility to give my own presentation to a small group of people
	- choice to go into the smaller room in order to have a smaller audience
- making friends with other volunteers; with the goal to keep in contact
- decision to take some time for me in the rest rooms to process information
- day planning of friday
	- taking some time to process,
	- but also focus on making the presentation

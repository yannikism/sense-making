==everything outside my sense-making is an extension==

- types
	- propositions = evergreen notes
	- question = context = issue = motivational background = wish
		- starting points
	- tautology = source
		-  has: definition 
			- via WordNet

- relations via breadcrumbs ::
	- outgoing links
		- support, explaination
		- contrast, opposition, limits, restrictions
	- backlink
		- extension of = extends = instanciate of = example of 
	- same level
		- advocate  = equal = mapping function

- use
	- define usage, purpose
		- wenn das nicht wäre, bräuchte man die file nicht

extension:: [[Discourse Graphs]]

- [ ] being able to display all sense making notes as a discourse graph. 
	- through links, backlinks, databases 
	- through Juggl Plugin:
```breadcrumbs
type: juggl
dir: down
layout: hierarchy
fdgdLayout: cola
fields:
depth: 0-
navigator: false
height: 200px
metaKeyHover: false
navigator: true
toolbar: true
autoAddNodes: true
autoExpand: false
autoZoom: true
```
---

- [ ] implement possibility to apply this personal sense making database to a group of people. 
	- aka modification of tautologies

- [ ] put in frontmatter: way of tracking [[reasoning paths]]
	- for example one *list attribute* with numbers [12, 2, 5]
		- element `n` represents its position in path `n` 
	- or for every path one attribute

- [ ] define icons for relations / types / recurring patterns

- chat gpt conversation = content, extension
	- every chatgpt output can be seen as new content creation on the same level as videos, books, graphics
- what is difference of *interpretation* and *proposition with truth = subjective*?

- property: evaluation of truth
	- value
		- maybe true
		- depends on feelings
		- depends on perspective
		- always true -> tautology
			- trotzdem subjektive tautology möglich!, wenn sich drauf geeinigt wird
	- each file contains conditions for *when it is true* (A AND B -> C OR D)
		- build [[logic graph]] with that?
	- transition to [[Fuzzy Logic]]

- [ ] get feedback from, in touch with [Debattierclub aachen](https://www.debatte.rwth-aachen.de/wordpress/?page_id=1435&lang=en)

seperate knowledge base and extensions
- extensions should be [[incremental knowledge]]
- knowledge must ==not== be [[incremental knowledge]]

### logic
- propositions -> claims, ...
- predicates -> supports, ...

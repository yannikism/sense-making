### Discussion

### Guidelines
which personal data do I wanna publish? which not?

- once it is pubslished, the internet never forgets
- knowledge that is public already 
	- don't try to control the flow of information
	- share in-progress work
	- after all it's all going to end up public anyway
- publish notes freely, to help people learn
	- no matter of attribution
	- no matter of money, commercialazation
	- no matter of kudo
- AI scraping notes
- don't disregard my own risk tolerances!


- I'm okay with posting my location when I'm at a big conference and I feel safe with the security at the event. 
- When I'm travelling for personal reasons, I never reveal my location until after I've already left. 
- I don't talk much about partners I have or even friends who aren't already "out" online in some way. 

### Law
which external resources am I allowed to publish by Law?

- if you can prove it belongs to you, then you own it
